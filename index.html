                    <div class="coach-info">
                        <p>A San Jose native, Ninik (rhymes with unique) fell in love with skating & competing at the age of 
                            5. Since then, she has been relentlessly dedicated to mastering both the art and science of skating. 
                            A former junior lady competitor, she has been coached by the likes of Laura Galindo-Black, Tracy 
                            Prussack & John Brancato. Ninik also spent her summers training with other renowned coaches at the 
                            Broadmoor World Arena.</p>
                        <p>Before beginning figure skating, Ninik began her 16 year ballet training, studying the Cecchetti Method 
                            under Glenna Bell Moenning. This training has very much influenced the way she teaches body awareness, 
                            artistry, and stage presence in her athletes. A life-long learner, Ninik is actively continuing her 
                            coaching education and collaborates with coaches from all over the world, bringing a fresh and innovative 
                            approach to her athletes.</p>
                        <p>Today, Ninik is on a mission to inspire passion and self-belief in all of the athletes she works with. 
                            She strongly believes in the power of grit by way of mental training to reach the ultimate heights of 
                            performance. She is particularly passionate about taking athletes from unsure to confident & self-assured 
                            in tackling difficult tasks.</p>
                        <p>Ninik works with all athletes, from beginner to high-level. She also encourages adult skating.</p>
